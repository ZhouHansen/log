## nginx reverse proxy

1. [configures NGINX to forward all requests from the public IP address to the server already listening on localhost](https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/use-nginx-reverse-proxy/#basic-configuration-for-an-nginx-reverse-proxy)

2. when doing react ssr, some framework(razzle) launchs the webpack dev server on the `localhost`(loopback adapter), which cause some assets(e.g. js bundle) not be accessed by other PC under the same network. This problem can be solved by nginx reverse the `localhost` to `192.168.X.X`(private addresses)

3. reverse proxy allows websocket:

```
location{
    proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```
