## nginx reverse proxy

1. [configures NGINX to forward all requests from the public IP address to the server already listening on localhost](https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/use-nginx-reverse-proxy/#basic-configuration-for-an-nginx-reverse-proxy)

2. when doing react ssr, some framework(razzle) launchs the webpack dev server on the `localhost`(loopback adapter), which cause some assets(e.g. js bundle) not be accessed by other PC under the same network. This problem can be solved by nginx reverse the `localhost` to `192.168.X.X`(private addresses)

3. reverse proxy allows websocket:

```
location{
    proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
}
```

## todo

1. razzle issue: webpack dev server host: https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle#how-razzle-works-the-secret-sauce.

## snippet

1. 网站备案，如果身份证和手机号与备案地点不在同一地点，要另外上传居住证或暂住证。

2. /github/projectA, /github/projectB ❌ /github/projectAWrap/projectA, /github/projectBWrap/projectB ✅,
   because there're e.g. deploy code and configure to be placed.

## linux

1. kill a port: `fuser -k 8080/tcp`, view all listening port: `lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN`

2. [install latest node, don't use nvm!](https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-and-npm-on-centos/), you can change upgrade and use the higher version by nvm, but when run npm and node from shell file, it still apply old node!

## auto deploy

1. [auto deploy](https://willbrowning.me/setting-up-automatic-deployment-and-builds-using-webhooks/)

2. using supervisor to make webhook forever:

Add this configure to `/etc/supervisord.conf`

```
[program:webhooks]
command=bash -c "~/work/bin/webhook -hooks /var/temp/hooks/hooks.json -verbose"
redirect_stderr=true
autostart=true
autorestart=true
numprocs=1
process_name=webhooks
```

```
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl start webhooks:*
sudo systemctl enable supervisord.service
```

3. after updating hooks.json and its deploy.sh, run `sudo supervisorctl restart webhooks:*`.
